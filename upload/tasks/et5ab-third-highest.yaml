  Write a function named `third_highest` that, given a list, returns the third
  highest element within the list. Assume that all elements are comparable with
  each other, i.e. `>` and `<` are supported between all elements. Do not modify
  the provided list. Return `None` if no such element exists. If some elements
  are equal, assume the first occurrence is the largest.
